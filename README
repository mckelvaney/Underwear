  UNDERWEAR

	Underwear is a solid foundation garment somewhat
	like a stout pair of underpants and a sensible vest
	sitting on top of Elliot Jay Stock's Naked theme using
	most of my usual defaults to give me a head start when
	making themes.
	
	Has a basic grid layout based on 20px. 8 Columns of
	100px with 20px gutter. Vertical rhythm of 20px which
	should comfortably support a body font size up to 15px
	but 14px is the default.

	Includes my minigrid.js which shows the guide grif when
	you hold down 'G' to keep you vertically rhythmic.
	
	ps. hat-tip to @dotjay btw. His https://github.com/dotjay/hashgrid
	is far better and came first...

	This is what Elliot had to say about Starkers...

	STARKERS

	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	Starkers is a bare-bones WordPress theme created 
	to act as a starting point for the theme designer.

	Free of all presentational elements and non-semantic 
	markup, Starkers is the perfect 'blank slate' for 
	your WordPress projects, as it's a stripped-back 
	version of the 'Twenty Ten' theme (versions prior to 
	3.0 were based on the now-retired 'Default' theme).

	Best of all: it's free and fully GPL-licensed, 
	so you can use it for whatever you like â€” even 
	your commercial projects.
